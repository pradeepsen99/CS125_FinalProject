# MTDBusApp
Final project for CS125

# Features
This application uses the MTD api to acess real time information from the MTD bus databse. Using the info we received we made an application that when you choose a stop displays realtime routes on the stop in chronological order.

# ToolsUsed
We used Java to code all of the project. Also used MTD REST Api to get the realtime bus info from their database.
